(ns structural-typing.assist.lifting
  "*Lifting* is a core concept, though one only writers of fairly unusual
   custom predicates need worry about.

   A predicate begins as something that takes a value and
   returns a truthy/falsey value. It is lifted into something that takes an [[exval]]
   (extended value) and returns a (possibly empty) sequence of [[oopsies]]. Condensed
   type descriptions are similarly converted into single functions that return oopsies.

(defn lift-pred
  "Convert a predicate into a function that produces either an empty
   sequence or a vector containing an [[oopsie]] describing
   the failure of the predicate. However, nothing is done to an 
   already-lifted predicate.

   Normally, the predicate is wrapped so that (1) a `nil` value is considered
   `true`, and (2) an exception during evaluation is considered `false`. These
   can be omitted with the `:check-nil` and `:allow-exceptions` protection-subtractions.

   The lifted predicate takes an [[exval]] as its argument.

  "Take a collection of condensed type descriptions. Canonicalize them.
   Convert the result into a function that returns [[oopsies]].

   The `type-map` is *not* a type-repo as given to [[named]] or [[type!]].
   It is rather a plain map from type signifiers to type descriptions. It can be 
   obtained by a type-repo with `(:canonicalized-type-descriptions type-repo)`."
