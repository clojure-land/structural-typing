   "An oopsie contains these fields, all potentially relevant when dealing with
   the failure of a predicate.

   * **whole-value**: the original value passed to [[built-like]].
   * **leaf-value**: the value passed to the predicate.
   * **path**: The specific path that lead from the whole value to the leaf value.
     It will not contain tokens like `ALL`; rather; it will contain specific indexes.
   * **predicate**: The predicate (any callable) that failed. Note: this is the original,
     not the version from [[lift-pred]].
   * **predicate-string**: a friendly string, such as `even?` instead
     of `#<core$even_QMARK_ clojure.core$even_QMARK_@47a01b6e>`
   * **explainer**: A function that explains this particular oopsie, usually
     naming the original predicate, path, and leaf value. It usually produces a string, 
     but it could produce anything that your custom failure handler handles.

   This var doesn't actually do anything. It's just here as the endpoint for 
   links in docstrings."
